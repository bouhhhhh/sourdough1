    "description": "Where else can you find FRESH sourdough starter - not dried?\n\nIf you love bread, pancakes, bagels – you name it – you'll love sourdough baking. It's versatile, delicious, and will broaden your baking horizons! The first place to start your sourdough journey is with your own sourdough starter. Ours is descended from a starter that's been lovingly nurtured here in New England for decades. When you feed it (all you need is flour, water, and a little bit of patience), it quickly becomes your own, adapting itself to your own region and climate. Thousands of bakers before you have made wonderful sourdough bread with a bit of this same bubbling brew. Join the ranks of satisfied sourdough bakers.",
