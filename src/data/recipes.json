        "step": 1,
        "instruction": "Remove your sourdough starter from the refrigerator if storing it dormant. Let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. Observe its appearance – it should have a slightly sour smell but not unpleasant."

      {
        "step": 2,
        "instruction": "Discard about half of your starter (or use it in recipes like pancakes or crackers). You should have approximately 1/2 cup remaining. This step prevents your starter from growing too large and ensures it gets fresh nutrients."
      },
      {
        "step": 3,
        "instruction": "Add 1/2 cup of room temperature water to your starter. Stir vigorously with a clean utensil until the starter is dissolved and the mixture is milky. This helps distribute the yeast and bacteria evenly."
      },
      {
        "step": 4,
        "instruction": "Add 1/2 cup of flour to the water-starter mixture. Stir until no dry flour remains and the mixture is smooth and thick, like a thick pancake batter. Scrape down the sides of the jar."
      },
      {
        "step": 5,
        "instruction": "Mark the level of your starter on the jar with a rubber band or piece of tape. This helps you monitor its growth. Cover loosely with a lid or breathable cloth secured with a rubber band. The starter needs airflow but protection from contaminants."
      },
      {
        "step": 6,
        "instruction": "Place the jar in a warm spot (70-75°F / 21-24°C is ideal). Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources. Let it sit for 4-12 hours, depending on temperature and starter activity. It's ready when it has doubled in size, shows lots of bubbles, and has a pleasant sour aroma."

Dried starter: Spread thinly on parchment, dry completely, crumble, and store in airtight container for long-term backup."
